<h3 align="center">Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of OS-level virtualization on Linux..</h3>


### Flow

In this course, you'll follow a series of hands-on exercises that demonstrate how to use containers for your applications. You'll start with the basics: creating and running your first Docker containers. By the end of the course, you'll get a brief introduction to running containers in production.



Enjoy the course!

<h3>BADM-4830</h3>
</p>

1. login to the development virtual machine VM hosted on AWS cloud

	 `
    ssh ubuntu@XX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    `
    
    *Make sure to post your **ssh public key** to the Watson studio project used for this lesson
    
2. Navigate to class subdirectory

	`cd /home/ubuntu/4830`
3. Create & navigate to your own directory

	`mkdir userName`
	
	`cd userName`
	
	For example:
	
	`mkdir ivanp`
	
	`cd ivanp`
	
	
4. Clone NLU repository from github

	`git clone https://github.com/jiportilla/leeds-module-7.git`
	
5. Change directory to the module 7 directory

	`cd mod-7/`
6. Test your `docker` installation by running the following command:

	`docker run hello-world`
	
	You will see:
	
	```
	Hello from Docker.
	This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
	...
	```
###Hello World
7. Next, we are going to run a `Busybox` container on our system and get a taste of the `docker run` command. To get started, let's run the following in our terminal:.

	```
	docker pull busybox
	```
	You will see:
	
	```	
	Using default tag: latest
	latest: Pulling from library/busybox
	...
	```

	The `pull` command fetches the busybox image from the Docker registry and saves it to your system. You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system.
	
	`docker images`

8. Great! Let's now run a Docker container based on this image. Run the following command:

 `docker run busybox echo "Hello World from busybox`

9. Let's run a terminal in the busybox container with:

 `docker run -it busybox /bin/sh`
 
 Test you are running inside the container with:
 
 `ls`
 
 You will see:
 
 ```
bin   dev   etc   home  proc  root  sys   tmp   usr   var
 ```
 
 Exit the container
 
 `exit`

### Static Site

The first thing we're going to look at is how we can run a dead-simple static website. We're going to pull a Docker image from Docker Hub, run the container and see how easy it is to run a webserver.

1. Detached mode, run

`docker run -d -p 80:80 --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site`

In the above command, `-d` will detach our terminal, `-P` will publish all exposed ports to `80:80` and finally `--name` corresponds to a name we want to give. Now we can see the ports by running the `docker port [CONTAINER]` command:

`docker port static-site`

Check your browser to

`http://XX.XXX.XXX.XXX`

Using the IP address above.

Check running containers with

`docker ps`

Stop running container with:

`docker stop static-site`

Prune stopped containers with:

`docker container prune`


## Creating image

1. Make clean

   ```
   make clean
   ```

1. Build the image

   ```
   make build
   ```

1. Run the container

   ```
   make run
   ```

1. View the application in a browser at `XX.XXX.XXX.XXX:PORT`

where `XX.XXX.XXX.XXX` is the IP we used in the login step above and `PORT` is the port number provided in the `.env` file earlier.
